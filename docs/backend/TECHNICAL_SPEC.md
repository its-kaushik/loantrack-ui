# LoanTrack API - Technical Specification

> Business rules, calculations, and flows are in **BRD.md**. This document covers how the system is built.

---

## 1. Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js (LTS) | JS ecosystem, async I/O for API server |
| Framework | Express.js or NestJS | Express for simplicity, NestJS if you want structure/DI |
| Language | TypeScript | Type safety for financial calculations |
| Database | PostgreSQL | ACID compliance essential for financial transactions, strong relational model |
| ORM | Prisma | Type-safe queries, excellent migrations, good DX |
| Auth | JWT (access + refresh tokens) | Stateless auth, works well for API |
| File Storage | Local disk (start), S3-compatible later | For ID proofs and photos |
| Validation | Zod | Request body validation + OpenAPI schema source |
| API Docs | @asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi + swagger-ui-express | OpenAPI 3.0 spec generated programmatically from Zod schemas. Swagger UI at `/api-docs` (dev/test only). Raw spec at `/api-docs/swagger.json`. |

## 2. Multi-Tenancy Architecture

### Isolation Strategy

**Row-level isolation** with a `tenant_id` column on every data table.

- Every query is automatically scoped by `tenant_id` via Prisma middleware or a base repository class
- Composite unique constraints include `tenant_id` (e.g., Aadhaar is unique *per tenant*, not globally)
- All indexes include `tenant_id` as a leading column for query performance
- `tenant_id` is extracted from the JWT - **never** accepted from the client
- No cross-tenant joins or queries are ever permitted
- Foreign key references (e.g., loan.borrower_id) are validated to belong to the same tenant at the application layer
- File uploads stored in tenant-scoped paths: `uploads/{tenant_id}/...`
- If a tenant is suspended, all API calls for that tenant return 403

---

### 3.2 `users`

| billing_principal | DECIMAL(12,2) | NULLABLE | The principal used for calculating the **current** billing cycle's interest. Updated only at billing cycle boundaries (when a due date passes), not mid-cycle. See Section 8 "Billing Principal Lifecycle". |
| advance_interest_amount | DECIMAL(12,2) | NULLABLE | First month's interest collected at disbursement |
| last_interest_paid_through | DATE | NULLABLE | For migrated loans: all billing cycles up to this date are considered settled. NULL for native loans. |

**Check Constraints:**
- `CONSTRAINT check_remaining_principal_non_negative CHECK (remaining_principal IS NULL OR remaining_principal >= 0)` — if a race condition bypasses optimistic locking, the DB throws a hard error rather than allowing a negative balance.
- `CONSTRAINT check_billing_principal_non_negative CHECK (billing_principal IS NULL OR billing_principal >= 0)` — same safety net for the billing cycle principal.
- `CONSTRAINT check_total_collected_non_negative CHECK (total_collected >= 0)` — same safety net for daily loan collections.

**Loan Number Generation:**
- Format: `{TYPE_PREFIX}-{YEAR}-{SEQUENCE}` (e.g., "ML-2026-0042", "DL-2026-0183")
- `TYPE_PREFIX`: "ML" for monthly, "DL" for daily
- `YEAR`: 4-digit disbursement year
- `SEQUENCE`: Auto-incrementing per tenant, per year, per type. Padded to 4 digits.
- Generated server-side. Uses a `loan_number_sequences` counter table or PostgreSQL sequence per tenant.

**Status Transitions:**
```
ACTIVE -> CLOSED       (fully repaid)
ACTIVE -> DEFAULTED    (borrower absconded)
ACTIVE -> CANCELLED    (admin error - only if no approved payments beyond initial disbursement/advance interest)
DEFAULTED -> CLOSED    (recovered via guarantor)
DEFAULTED -> WRITTEN_OFF (unrecoverable loss)
```

## 5. API Design

### 5.1 Conventions

**Response Envelope** - All API responses use a consistent envelope:

Success response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

Error response:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Amount exceeds remaining principal",
    "details": []
  }
}
```

Use `sendSuccess(res, data)` from `src/utils/response.ts` for all success responses. The error handler in `src/middleware/error-handler.ts` wraps errors automatically.

**Pagination** - All list endpoints:
- Query params: `page` (default: 1), `limit` (default: 50, max: 100)
- Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 50,
    "total_count": 342,
    "total_pages": 7
  }
}
```

**OpenAPI Documentation** - Built incrementally per phase, not deferred:
- Every Zod schema includes `.openapi()` metadata (descriptions, examples)
- Every route is registered in `src/config/openapi-routes.ts` with tags, request/response schemas, and error responses
- Response schemas are wrapped in the success envelope via `createSuccessResponse()` from `src/schemas/responses.schema.ts`
- Reusable error responses (400/401/403/404/409/500) from `errorResponses` in the same file

Standard error codes:
| Code | HTTP Status | When |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Invalid request body, missing fields, business rule violation |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 | Missing or expired token |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Insufficient role, suspended tenant, wrong tenant |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Resource doesn't exist (within tenant scope) |
| `CONFLICT` | 409 | Optimistic locking failure, duplicate entry, invalid state transition |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected server error |

**Tenant Scoping** - All tenant-level endpoints are automatically scoped. `tenant_id` is extracted from the JWT, never from the client.

**Middleware chain:**
```
1. Auth middleware      -> Verify JWT, extract user_id, tenant_id, role
2. Tenant middleware    -> Inject tenant_id into request context, check tenant is ACTIVE
3. Role middleware      -> Check if user's role has access to this route
4. Route handler        -> All DB queries use req.tenantId
```

  "collateral_estimated_value": 50000,
  "notes": "optional",
  "pre_existing_penalties": [
    { "days_overdue": 45, "months_charged": 2, "penalty_amount": 10000, "status": "PENDING" }
  ]
}
```
- `total_base_collected_so_far`: **Base loan collections only** — payments toward the daily installments (principal + interest). **Do NOT include penalty payments** in this number. Penalty collections are tracked separately via `pre_existing_penalties` with status `PAID`. Mixing penalty money here would skew the principal-first profit calculation (the system would treat penalty revenue as principal recovery).
- An OPENING_BALANCE transaction is created for `total_base_collected_so_far` (excluded from Cash in Hand).
- `total_repayment_amount`, `daily_payment_amount`, and `term_end_date` are computed server-side from inputs.
- `pre_existing_penalties` is optional — only needed for overdue migrated loans. Each entry creates a `penalties` row so incremental penalty auto-calculation works correctly. Use status `PAID` for penalties already collected before migration, `PENDING` for outstanding ones.

### 5.7 Transactions / Payments

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/transactions` | Record a payment |
| POST | `/api/v1/transactions/bulk` | Record multiple daily collections in one request |
| GET | `/api/v1/transactions` | List. Filters: `loan_id`, `date`, `type`, `approval_status`, `collected_by` |
| GET | `/api/v1/transactions/pending` | All pending approvals (admin) |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/transactions/:id/approve` | Approve pending payment (admin) |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/transactions/:id/reject` | Reject pending payment with reason (admin) |

**Single payment POST body:**
```json
{
  "loan_id": "uuid",
  "amount": 1000,
  "transaction_type": "DAILY_COLLECTION",
  "transaction_date": "2026-01-30",
  "penalty_id": "uuid (optional — required for PENALTY type)",
  "effective_date": "2026-01-15 (optional — billing cycle date for INTEREST_PAYMENT)",
  "notes": "optional"
}
```
- `transaction_type`: Required. One of: `INTEREST_PAYMENT`, `PRINCIPAL_RETURN`, `DAILY_COLLECTION`, `PENALTY`, `GUARANTOR_PAYMENT`
- `penalty_id`: Required when `transaction_type = PENALTY`. If omitted, system auto-selects the oldest unpaid penalty for the loan.
- `effective_date`: Required when `transaction_type = INTEREST_PAYMENT` (identifies the billing cycle).
- Admin: auto-approved. Collector: PENDING.

**Loan status validation on payment submission:**
- `ACTIVE` loans: accepted.
- `DEFAULTED` loans: accepted (recovery/guarantor payments are valid).
- `CANCELLED` loans: **rejected** (400 — cancelled loans are treated as if they never existed).
- `CLOSED` / `WRITTEN_OFF` loans: **rejected** (400 — finalized loans accept no further payments).

**Corrective transaction POST body (admin only):**
```json
{
  "loan_id": "uuid",
  "amount": -1000,
  "transaction_type": "DAILY_COLLECTION",
  "transaction_date": "2026-01-30",
  "corrected_transaction_id": "uuid (required — the original transaction being reversed)",
  "notes": "Correction: wrong amount recorded"
}
```
- Negative `amount` signals a corrective transaction.
- `corrected_transaction_id` is required — must reference an existing APPROVED transaction of the same type on the same loan.
- Side effects are reversed (see Section 8 "Corrective Transactions").

**Bulk collection POST body:**
```
Header: Idempotency-Key: <client-generated UUID>
```
```json
{
  "collections": [
    { "loan_id": "uuid", "amount": 1000, "transaction_date": "2026-01-30", "notes": "" },
    { "loan_id": "uuid", "amount": 500, "transaction_date": "2026-01-30", "notes": "" }
  ]
}
```
- `Idempotency-Key` header required for bulk submissions. Duplicate keys return the cached original response.
- All entries get same `collected_by` (from JWT) and `approval_status`
- Partial success allowed: `{ "created": 18, "failed": 2, "errors": [...] }`

**Approval-gated side effects:**
State mutations (remaining_principal update, penalty amount_collected, principal_returns record) execute ONLY when a transaction is approved, not on creation. See BRD.md Section 6 for details.

## 6. Security

### Tenant Isolation
- `tenant_id` derived from JWT, never from client
- Every DB query includes `WHERE tenant_id = ?` via ORM middleware
- FK references validated to belong to same tenant
- File uploads in tenant-scoped paths: `uploads/{tenant_id}/...`
- Suspended tenants: all API calls return 403

### Authentication & Authorization
- Passwords: bcrypt, min 12 rounds
- JWT: 15 min access token, 7 day refresh token
- JWT payload: `{ user_id, tenant_id, role }`
- Three-tier RBAC: SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, COLLECTOR
- Collector restrictions: cannot create loans, approve payments, mark defaults, issue waivers, access fund data, access expenses, manage users, view reports
- Collector data visibility: can only see ACTIVE loans and their borrower details (name, phone, address). Cannot see closed, defaulted, written-off, or cancelled loans.

### Data Safety
- All financial amounts: `DECIMAL(12,2)` - never floating point
- All state changes create audit trails (timestamps + user references)
- Financial records are never hard-deleted (soft-delete with `is_deleted`)
- Approved transactions are final - corrections via new transactions, not edits
- ID proof documents served through authenticated + tenant-scoped endpoints

### Infrastructure
- SQL injection: prevented by parameterized queries (Prisma)
- Rate limiting per tenant
- CORS: configure allowed origins per environment

## 7. Fund & Profit Calculation Queries

> These are the technical implementations of the formulas in BRD.md Section 9.

**Important — Prisma limitation:** The queries below use `CASE WHEN`, `GREATEST`, `COALESCE`, subqueries, and cross-table aggregations that Prisma's type-safe query API does not support natively. **Do not attempt to convert these into Prisma syntax.** Use `prisma.$queryRaw` for all report, dashboard, and fund summary queries. Store these SQL queries as constants or `.sql` files in the repository so the principal-first logic executes exactly as written by the database engine. Prisma's query builder should only be used for standard CRUD operations (create/read/update on single tables).

### Fund Summary

```sql
-- Total Capital Invested
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN entry_type = 'INJECTION' THEN amount ELSE -amount END), 0)
FROM fund_entries WHERE tenant_id = ?;

-- Money Deployed (CANCELLED loans excluded by status filter)
-- Monthly: remaining_principal tracked directly on the loan
-- Daily: principal-first — every collection reduces deployed capital until principal recovered
SELECT
  COALESCE((SELECT SUM(remaining_principal) FROM loans WHERE tenant_id = ? AND status = 'ACTIVE' AND loan_type = 'MONTHLY'), 0)
  +
  COALESCE((
    SELECT SUM(GREATEST(principal_amount - total_collected, 0))
    FROM loans
    WHERE tenant_id = ? AND status = 'ACTIVE' AND loan_type = 'DAILY'
  ), 0);

-- Cash in Hand (excludes OPENING_BALANCE, waivers, and CANCELLED loan transactions)
SELECT
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN entry_type = 'INJECTION' THEN amount ELSE -amount END), 0) FROM fund_entries WHERE tenant_id = ?)
  -
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0) FROM transactions t JOIN loans l ON t.loan_id = l.id WHERE t.tenant_id = ? AND t.transaction_type = 'DISBURSEMENT' AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED' AND l.status != 'CANCELLED')
  +
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0) FROM transactions t JOIN loans l ON t.loan_id = l.id WHERE t.tenant_id = ? AND t.transaction_type IN ('ADVANCE_INTEREST','INTEREST_PAYMENT','PRINCIPAL_RETURN','DAILY_COLLECTION','PENALTY','GUARANTOR_PAYMENT') AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED' AND l.status != 'CANCELLED')
  -
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) FROM expenses WHERE tenant_id = ? AND is_deleted = false);
```

### Total Interest Earned (Aggregate)

```sql
-- Monthly interest earned (across all monthly loans for the tenant)
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0)
FROM transactions t
JOIN loans l ON t.loan_id = l.id
WHERE t.tenant_id = ? AND t.transaction_type IN ('INTEREST_PAYMENT', 'ADVANCE_INTEREST')
  AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED' AND l.status != 'CANCELLED';

-- Daily interest earned (principal-first: interest recognized only after principal recovered)
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(GREATEST(l.total_collected - l.principal_amount, 0)), 0)
FROM loans l
WHERE l.tenant_id = ? AND l.loan_type = 'DAILY' AND l.status != 'CANCELLED';

-- Penalties collected
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0)
FROM transactions t
JOIN loans l ON t.loan_id = l.id
WHERE t.tenant_id = ? AND t.transaction_type = 'PENALTY'
  AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED' AND l.status != 'CANCELLED';

-- Total Interest Earned = monthly_interest + daily_interest + penalties_collected
```

### Money Lost to Defaults (Aggregate)

```sql
-- Monthly default losses
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(l.remaining_principal), 0)
  - COALESCE((
    SELECT SUM(t.amount) FROM transactions t
    WHERE t.tenant_id = ? AND t.transaction_type = 'GUARANTOR_PAYMENT'
      AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED'
      AND t.loan_id IN (SELECT id FROM loans WHERE tenant_id = ? AND loan_type = 'MONTHLY' AND status IN ('DEFAULTED', 'WRITTEN_OFF'))
  ), 0)
FROM loans l
WHERE l.tenant_id = ? AND l.loan_type = 'MONTHLY' AND l.status IN ('DEFAULTED', 'WRITTEN_OFF');

-- Daily default losses
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(GREATEST(l.principal_amount - l.total_collected, 0)), 0)
  - COALESCE((
    SELECT SUM(t.amount) FROM transactions t
    WHERE t.tenant_id = ? AND t.transaction_type = 'GUARANTOR_PAYMENT'
      AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED'
      AND t.loan_id IN (SELECT id FROM loans WHERE tenant_id = ? AND loan_type = 'DAILY' AND status IN ('DEFAULTED', 'WRITTEN_OFF'))
  ), 0)
FROM loans l
WHERE l.tenant_id = ? AND l.loan_type = 'DAILY' AND l.status IN ('DEFAULTED', 'WRITTEN_OFF');
```

### Revenue Forgone

```sql
-- Interest waived
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0)
FROM transactions t
JOIN loans l ON t.loan_id = l.id
WHERE t.tenant_id = ? AND t.transaction_type = 'INTEREST_WAIVER'
  AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED' AND l.status != 'CANCELLED';

-- Penalties waived
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(p.waived_amount), 0)
FROM penalties p
JOIN loans l ON p.loan_id = l.id
WHERE p.tenant_id = ? AND l.status != 'CANCELLED';

-- Revenue Forgone = interest_waived + penalties_waived
```

### Net Profit

```sql
-- Net Profit = Total Interest Earned - Money Lost to Defaults - Total Expenses
-- Computed from the above queries. Not stored.
```

---

### Per-Loan Profit (Monthly)

```sql
-- Profit for a monthly loan = all interest payments + advance interest
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0) AS interest_earned
FROM transactions t
WHERE t.loan_id = ? AND t.transaction_type IN ('INTEREST_PAYMENT', 'ADVANCE_INTEREST')
  AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED';

-- If defaulted: loss = remaining_principal minus guarantor recoveries
SELECT
  l.remaining_principal - COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0) AS principal_loss
FROM loans l
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON t.loan_id = l.id
  AND t.transaction_type = 'GUARANTOR_PAYMENT' AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED'
WHERE l.id = ? AND l.status IN ('DEFAULTED', 'WRITTEN_OFF')
GROUP BY l.remaining_principal;
```

### Per-Loan Profit (Daily) — Principal-First

```sql
-- Interest earned for a closed daily loan (total_collected >= total_repayment)
SELECT total_collected - principal_amount AS interest_earned
FROM loans WHERE id = ? AND status = 'CLOSED' AND loan_type = 'DAILY';

-- Interest earned for an active daily loan (zero until principal recovered)
SELECT GREATEST(total_collected - principal_amount, 0) AS interest_earned
FROM loans WHERE id = ? AND status = 'ACTIVE' AND loan_type = 'DAILY';

-- Principal loss for a defaulted daily loan
SELECT
  GREATEST(l.principal_amount - l.total_collected, 0)
  - COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0) AS principal_loss
FROM loans l
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON t.loan_id = l.id
  AND t.transaction_type = 'GUARANTOR_PAYMENT' AND t.approval_status = 'APPROVED'
WHERE l.id = ? AND l.status IN ('DEFAULTED', 'WRITTEN_OFF') AND l.loan_type = 'DAILY'
GROUP BY l.principal_amount, l.total_collected;
```

## 8. Key Implementation Notes

### Database Transactions (Atomicity)

All multi-step financial operations MUST run inside a database transaction (`Prisma.$transaction()` or `BEGIN/COMMIT`). If any step fails, everything rolls back.

**Operations requiring transactions:**

| Operation | Steps (all-or-nothing) |
|---|---|
| Monthly loan disbursement | Insert loan (set `remaining_principal` and `billing_principal` = `principal_amount`) → insert DISBURSEMENT txn → insert ADVANCE_INTEREST txn → insert loan_number_sequence update |
| Daily loan disbursement | Insert loan → insert DISBURSEMENT txn → insert loan_number_sequence update |
| Transaction approval | Update txn to APPROVED → execute side effects (see Approval State Machine below) |
| Transaction rejection | Update txn to REJECTED (single step, but still wrap for consistency) |
| Penalty imposition | Insert penalty → (no side effects until payment) |
| Penalty waiver | Update penalty (waived_amount, net_payable, status) → insert PENALTY_WAIVER txn |
| Interest waiver | Insert INTEREST_WAIVER txn |
| Loan closure | Validate closure conditions → update loan status + closure_date |
| Loan default | Update loan status + `defaulted_at`/`defaulted_by` → set `customers.is_defaulter = true` on borrower |
| Loan cancellation | Validate no payments → update loan status + cancellation fields |
| Corrective transaction | Insert corrective txn → execute reversed side effects (same scope as approval side effects but in reverse) |
| Bulk collection | Each collection in its own transaction. Partial success allowed — failures don't roll back successes. |

### Concurrency & Locking

Financial mutations must prevent race conditions. Two strategies used:

**1. Optimistic locking for loan state changes:**
Add `version INTEGER DEFAULT 1` to the `loans` table. Every update includes `WHERE version = :expected_version` and increments version. If the row was modified by another request, the WHERE clause matches 0 rows → return 409 Conflict → client retries.

Prevents: two simultaneous PRINCIPAL_RETURN approvals that each pass validation individually but together exceed remaining_principal.

**2. SELECT ... FOR UPDATE for critical sections:**
Used where optimistic locking isn't practical (counter tables, penalty updates).

| Scenario | Lock Target |
|---|---|
| Loan number generation | `loan_number_sequences` row — already documented |
| Penalty payment approval | `penalties` row — prevents two payments exceeding net_payable |
| Transaction approval | `transactions` row — prevents double-approval |

**3. Transaction isolation levels:**
- Default: `READ COMMITTED` (PostgreSQL default) — sufficient for most operations
- Fund summary / dashboard aggregations: use `REPEATABLE READ` to avoid inconsistent reads during concurrent writes (e.g., a payment being approved while the dashboard query runs)
- Loan number generation: handled by `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` within `READ COMMITTED`

**4. Idempotency for collector bulk submissions:**
Each bulk collection request includes a client-generated `idempotency_key` (header: `Idempotency-Key`). Server stores it in a dedicated table and rejects duplicate submissions. Prevents double-recording from network retries.

**`idempotency_keys` table:**

| Column | Type | Constraints | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| key | VARCHAR(255) | PK | Client-generated unique key |
| tenant_id | UUID | FK -> tenants.id, NOT NULL | |
| user_id | UUID | FK -> users.id, NOT NULL | |
| response_status | INTEGER | NOT NULL | HTTP status of the original response |
| response_body | JSONB | NOT NULL | Cached response to return on replay |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT now() | |
| expires_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | Auto-expire after 24 hours. Periodic cleanup via scheduled job or TTL index. |

### Approval State Machine
```
Transaction created (by collector) -> PENDING
  -> Admin approves -> APPROVED -> side effects execute atomically
  -> Admin rejects  -> REJECTED -> no side effects
Transaction created (by admin) -> APPROVED immediately -> side effects execute
```

**Side effects per transaction type (on approval):**
| Type | Side Effect |
|---|---|
| PRINCIPAL_RETURN | Decrement `loans.remaining_principal`, insert `principal_returns`. **Does NOT update `billing_principal`** — that syncs at cycle boundary. |
| PENALTY | Update `penalties.amount_collected` and `penalties.status` |
| PENALTY_WAIVER | Update `penalties.waived_amount`, `net_payable`, `status` |
| DAILY_COLLECTION, GUARANTOR_PAYMENT | Increment `loans.total_collected` (daily loans only) |

**Side effects per loan status change:**
| Status Change | Side Effect |
|---|---|
| ACTIVE → DEFAULTED | Set `customers.is_defaulter = true` for the borrower. Record `defaulted_at`, `defaulted_by`. |
| DEFAULTED → CLOSED | Record `closure_date`, `closed_by`. (Does NOT auto-clear `is_defaulter` — admin must do this manually via the clear-defaulter endpoint.) |
| DEFAULTED → WRITTEN_OFF | Record `written_off_at`, `written_off_by`. |
| ACTIVE → CLOSED | Record `closure_date`, `closed_by`. |
| ACTIVE → CANCELLED | Record `cancelled_at`, `cancelled_by`, `cancellation_reason`. |

### Billing Principal Lifecycle

The `billing_principal` column stores the principal amount used for the current billing cycle's interest calculation. Unlike `remaining_principal` (which updates immediately on any principal return), `billing_principal` only updates at cycle boundaries.

```
Lifecycle:
1. On DISBURSEMENT:
   billing_principal = principal_amount
   remaining_principal = principal_amount

2. On PRINCIPAL_RETURN (mid-cycle):
   remaining_principal -= return_amount   (immediate)
   billing_principal   = unchanged        (holds the old value until the cycle ends)

3. On billing cycle boundary (when due date passes and cycle is settled):
   billing_principal = remaining_principal  (sync)
   This runs when:
   - The first payment/waiver for a new cycle is recorded, OR
   - The overdue detection job iterates past a due date

4. On MIGRATION:
   billing_principal = remaining_principal  (both set to the migrated value)
```

**Why this matters:** Without `billing_principal`, calculating interest due requires a fragile reverse-query: `remaining_principal + SUM(mid-cycle returns)`. With it, interest due is a deterministic lookup: `billing_principal × interest_rate / 100`.

### Monthly Interest Overpayment Auto-Split
When recording an INTEREST_PAYMENT for a monthly loan, interest due = `billing_principal × interest_rate / 100`. This is always correct because `billing_principal` holds the principal from the start of the current cycle (BRD Section 2.1 — mid-cycle returns take effect next cycle).

```
If amount <= interest_due:
  -> Create single INTEREST_PAYMENT transaction
If amount > interest_due:
  -> Create INTEREST_PAYMENT for interest_due amount
  -> Create PRINCIPAL_RETURN for (amount - interest_due)
  -> Execute PRINCIPAL_RETURN side effects (decrement remaining_principal, insert principal_returns)
  -> billing_principal is NOT updated (stays at cycle-start value)
Both transactions are created atomically within a single DB transaction.
```

### Corrective Transactions
Admin-only. Used to reverse a mistake after approval. A corrective transaction:
- Has the same `transaction_type` as the original
- Has a **negative `amount`** (the only case where amount can be negative)
- References the original via `corrected_transaction_id` (FK to `transactions.id`)
- Is auto-approved (admin action)
- Triggers **reversed side effects**:
  - Corrective PRINCIPAL_RETURN of -5,000 → increments `remaining_principal` by 5,000 (does NOT touch `billing_principal`), inserts a `principal_returns` record with negative `amount_returned`
  - Corrective DAILY_COLLECTION of -1,000 → decrements `loans.total_collected` by 1,000
  - Corrective GUARANTOR_PAYMENT of -2,000 → decrements `loans.total_collected` by 2,000 (daily loans)
  - Corrective PENALTY of -500 → decrements `penalties.amount_collected` by 500, recalculates penalty status
  - Corrective INTEREST_PAYMENT → no loan-level side effect (interest payments don't mutate loan state)
- Both original and corrective transactions remain in the audit trail
- **Validation**: the corrected transaction must be APPROVED, same loan, same type. Only one correction per transaction.

### Guarantor Warning (Computed)
On `GET /api/v1/customers/:id`, include a computed field:
```json
{
  "guarantor_warnings": [
    { "loan_id": "uuid", "loan_number": "DL-2026-0042", "borrower_name": "...", "status": "DEFAULTED" }
  ]
}
```
Query: find all loans where `guarantor_id = customer.id` AND `status IN ('DEFAULTED', 'WRITTEN_OFF')`. This is informational — does not set `is_defaulter`.

### Monthly Billing Cycle Settlement (Computed)

A billing cycle is identified by its due date (the `effective_date` on transactions). A cycle is **settled** when:
```
SUM(INTEREST_PAYMENT amounts for this cycle) + SUM(INTEREST_WAIVER amounts for this cycle)
  >= interest_due for this cycle
```

Interest due for a cycle = `billing_principal × interest_rate / 100` (see "Billing Principal Lifecycle" above).

**There is no stored "settled" flag.** Settlement is always computed on the fly from transactions. This avoids stale state and is the source of truth for:
- **Overdue detection** (BRD 7.5): iterate from the cycle after `last_interest_paid_through` (migrated) or the first cycle after disbursement (native) up to the current month. Any unsettled cycle = overdue.
- **Closure validation** (BRD 7.4): all cycles from disbursement through the final cycle must be settled.
- **Dashboard overdue list**: count of unsettled cycles = months overdue.

**For migrated loans**: all cycles up to and including `last_interest_paid_through` are considered settled without checking transactions. Only cycles after that date are computed from transactions.

---

### Monthly Due Date Computation
`monthly_due_day` is **immutable** — set once at disbursement (extracted from `disbursement_date`), stored on the loan, never changed. The computed due date adapts per month but always "bounces back" to the original day when the month is long enough (e.g., 31 → Feb 28 → Mar 31).

```typescript
function getDueDate(monthly_due_day: number, year: number, month: number): Date {
  const lastDay = new Date(year, month, 0).getDate(); // last day of month
  const day = Math.min(monthly_due_day, lastDay);
  return new Date(year, month - 1, day);
}
// Examples with monthly_due_day = 31:
//   getDueDate(31, 2026, 1) -> Jan 31
//   getDueDate(31, 2026, 2) -> Feb 28
//   getDueDate(31, 2026, 3) -> Mar 31  (reverts back)
```

### Loan Number Generation
```
Counter table: loan_number_sequences (tenant_id, year, loan_type, current_value)
On loan creation:
  1. SELECT ... FOR UPDATE (lock the row)
  2. Increment current_value
  3. Format: "{ML|DL}-{YEAR}-{padded sequence}"
```

### Penalty Auto-Calculation (Incremental Stacking)
When admin triggers "impose penalty" on an overdue daily loan:
```
1. total_months_owed = CEIL(days_overdue / 30)
2. months_already_penalised = SUM(months_charged) from ALL penalties on this loan
   (includes PENDING, PARTIALLY_PAID, PAID, and WAIVED — waived penalties still count)
3. incremental_months = total_months_owed - months_already_penalised
4. If incremental_months <= 0 -> no new penalty needed
5. new_penalty_amount = principal_amount x interest_rate / 100 x incremental_months
6. System presents this to admin for confirmation (admin can override amount)
7. Create penalty record with months_charged = incremental_months
```

### Loan Cancellation
```
1. Validate loan status = ACTIVE
2. Validate no APPROVED transactions exist for this loan
   EXCEPT: DISBURSEMENT and ADVANCE_INTEREST (the initial creation transactions)
3. Validate no PENDING transactions exist for this loan
   (prevents race condition: collector submitted offline, admin cancels before sync)
   If PENDING transactions exist, admin must reject them first, then cancel.
4. Set status = CANCELLED, record reason and who cancelled
5. CANCELLED loans are excluded from ALL financial calculations

**Offline collector edge case:** If a collector is offline and has cash for a loan that gets cancelled before they sync, their submission will be rejected (CANCELLED loans reject all payments). The admin and collector reconcile manually — the money is returned to the borrower or re-allocated to the correct loan. This is the correct behavior since cancellation means the loan was a mistake.

### Migration
- No DISBURSEMENT transaction for migrated loans
- `is_migrated = true` on the loan record
- **Monthly loans**: No OPENING_BALANCE transaction. State is set directly:
  - `principal_amount` = original amount given
  - `remaining_principal` = current outstanding amount
  - `last_interest_paid_through` = last billing cycle already settled. Overdue detection skips all cycles <= this date.
- **Daily loans**: An OPENING_BALANCE transaction records `total_base_collected_so_far` (base loan collections only, excluding penalty payments).
  - Included in loan-level `total_collected` (drives days_paid, total_remaining, closure condition)
  - Excluded from `Cash in Hand` calculation (money was collected before the system)
  - If the loan is already overdue, admin can optionally enter pre-existing penalty records (months_charged, penalty_amount, status). These are standard `penalties` rows — no schema changes needed. The penalty auto-calculation then correctly computes incremental months.
